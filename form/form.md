# Forms

Manage your PDF forms.

* List form fields
* Remove fields by id
* Lock fields by id
* Unlock fields by id
* Reset fields by id
* Export form to JSON
* Fill form via JSON/CSV
* Multifill forms via JSON/CSV

The focus of this command set is manipulating forms that were created using `pdfcpu create`.

You are welcome to try them on existing forms and they may even work!
Issues are expected though so please report back any strange behavior
based on using Adobe Reader only.
